JT Skimmer is a freeware, open source 64-bit Windows applicaton for Radio Amateurs.
Its main purpose is to monitor the band for digital signals and decode multiple
WSJT-X modes, on multiple frequencies, 24 hours a day - and help the operator catch
band openings and activity from the rare entities. This is especially useful on 6m 
because of its unpredictable propagation, but the program may be used on any band.

## System Requirements

- **SDR:** 
  [Airspy R2](https://airspy.com/airspy-r2/),
  [Airspy Mini](https://airspy.com/airspy-mini/),
  [RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/),
  SDRplay [RSP1](https://www.sdrplay.com/rsp1/),
  [RSP1a](https://www.sdrplay.com/rsp1a/),
  [RSP1b](https://www.sdrplay.com/rsp1b/),
  [RSP2](https://www.sdrplay.com/rsp2/), 
  [RSP DX](https://www.sdrplay.com/rspdx/);

- **computer:** I tested JT Skimmer on a Core i7-6700K CPU, 32Gb RAM system.
  Since the program runs multipe decoders,
  you will want to use a CPU with more than one core;

- **graphics card:** must support OpenGL 3.3 or higher;

- **operating system:** Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit. There is no 32-bit
  version, the computers fast enough to run multiple decoders are all 64-bit systems;

- **drivers:** the driver for your SDR must be installed. If you can use your radio with some
  general-purpose SDR software, such as
  [SDR Console](https://www.sdr-radio.com/console),
  [SDR#](https://airspy.com/download/)
  or [HDSDR](http://hdsdr.de/),
  then your driver is OK;

- **software:** these programs should be installed on your system:
  - [WSJT-X](https://wsjt.sourceforge.io/wsjtx.html) v.2.7.0-rc4 or higher: required,
  - [JTDX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jtdx/): optional.
