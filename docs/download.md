### Release Notes

#### v.0.94 Beta
  - message counts are now displayed in the Messages panel
  
  - a noise blanker  has been added. This is an experimental function. I was unable to test
  it properly because there is no impulsive noise at my location, so please give it a try
  if your enironment allows that. There are three options:
    - Off - no noise blanking;
    - NR0V - the classical noise blanker, as in other SDR software;
    - VE3NEA - a new, non-linear noise blanker.
  
    Please see which of the two works better.

#### v.0.93 Beta
  - fixed the crash when the drivers are not installed

#### v.0.92 Beta
  - the first public (beta) release
