Several years ago I built an RF splitter to feed my Icom-7610 and an SDR dongle 
from the same antenna, using the schematics published by Jack Smith K8ZOA (SK) on his web site.
The web site is no longer available, but Wayback Machine still keeps a copy of his 
[Notes on Building](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225093913if_/http://cliftonlaboratories.com/Documents/Notes%20on%20Building%20a%20Z10050A.pdf).


Here is the schematic:

The parameters of the splitter, measured with
[NanoVNA](https://nanovna.com/), are shown below.

_Loss_

![Splitter Input Impedance]({{"/assets/images/blog/splitter_input.png" | relative_url}})
_Input Impedance_

![Splitter Output Impedance]({{"/assets/images/blog/splitter_output.png" | relative_url}})
_Output Impedance_

![Splitter Isolation]({{"/assets/images/blog/splitter_isolation.png" | relative_url}})
_Isolation_


Here is a comparison of the homebrew splitter and 
[ZX10-2-12-S+](https://www.minicircuits.com/pdfs/ZX10-2-12-S+.pdf)
sold by Mini-Circuits, in the 2-50 MHz frequency range:


|Splitter|Loss, dB|Isolation, dB|
|:-------|:---|:--------|
|K8ZOA|3.05 - 3.22|26.3 - 32.1|
|ZX10-2-12-S+|3.30 - 3.26|27.3 - 32.3|

I am using this splitter for side-by-side comparison of the decoding performance 
of differnt SDR receivers in the JT Skimmer program:
